<title>1.2.1/ The dynamic-graph is ... a graph</title>
<para><image type="html" name="robot_state_reference_from_slider.jpeg">Figure 1: Example of a graph based on https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/amd-clmc/dg_demos/blob/master/python/dg_demos/filter_graph.py.</image>
 The above figure depicts a simple graph that takes as input a vector of 4 dimension containing 4 doubles (e.g. user inputs from some slider) and output a desired configuration for a quadruped robot. First step consist in filtering it and scale it to the desired reference. Then we define the hip joints to be the reference from the scaled_slider. The knee are a scaled version of the hip (knee_joint = hip_joint * (-2)). Then we concatenate the signals back to one simple vector which will be the reference state of fro a quadruped robot.</para><para>The idea of having a graph is that once a part of the graph works, it can be concatenated and can be seen as a simple node. The other powerful thing about graphs is that they can be conceptually easy to understand (not easy to use nor debug but everyone knows what a graph is ^^). The dynamic graph IS therefore a GRAPH, so it has inputs and outputs. Typically the inputs of the graph we will use are the robot sensors, and its outputs are the motor controls. Which boils down to the definition of a controller. For example, a simple graph would read the robot joint states and velocities and compute a PD controller resulting in a torque output. The concept is actually more general: A control graph is made up of no des , which consume and emit signals. For instance, it is also possible to implement a filter. Such a filter would consume the current robot state and perform a smoothing on the state measurements.</para><para>In the next section we will describe the vocabulary that is used with the dynamic-graph.</para></sect3>

<sect3 id="index_1intro_subsec_use">
<title>1.2.3/ Typical use of the dynamic graph / Hardware communication</title>
<para>The &quot;outside&quot; of the graph is typically considered as the robot hardware. An abstraction of this &quot;hardware&quot;, which can be virtually anything, is done by configuring the sensors and controls as signals. So in essence we create an entity that will access the hardware sensors and feed them to the graph as output signals and get back the controls as input signals. In order to configure automatically this entity we used a YAML file. We are thinking about a way to create this class from a YAML file, which would be more consistent because the urdf format is very standard.</para></sect3>

 Consider the graph above (figure 3). In this graph the output signal of robot_des_state is not represented but in this particular case let us call it &quot;sout&quot; like &quot;signal out&quot;. In order to execute the complete graph in figure 1 one needs to call for an update of the final output signal. Meaning that one will call: <programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">robot_des_state.sout.recompute(current_time)</highlight></codeline>
</programlisting> This will trigger a the evaluation of a callback method in the robot_des_ state entity if current_time&gt;last_recomputed_time. This time management allows you to change the period of reevaluation of each signals.</para><para>Let us now assume we triggered the evaluation of robot_des_state.sout with a big enough time "<bold>T</bold>" number so the callback function is evaluated.

The fact that front_legs_state.sout is plugged to robot_des_state.sin1 imply that when robot_des_state.sin1 data is accessed front_legs_state. sout will be recomputed at time T to provide the data.</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">INFORMATION:</highlight></codeline>

<title>1.3.3/ The concept of a command</title>
<para>So far the idea is that the last output signal provides the command to the robot which supposed to happen periodically. The purpose of a command is to manage asynchronous event. Typically a user command. For example on has implemented a filter like in figure 2. A user command will be helpful for 2 things:<orderedlist>
