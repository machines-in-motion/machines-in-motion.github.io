\section*{Shared Memory}

\subsection*{what it is}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This library is a convenient wrapper over boost\+:interprocess. It is meant to be trivial to use, and to make interprocess communication between processes trivial
\item It is meant to be realtime friendly (no dynamic allocation)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{how it works / A\+PI}

An example covering the complete A\+PI is in \href{https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/amd-clmc/shared_memory/tree/master/src/examples}{\tt src/examples} . You may run the related executables.

\subsection*{how to run the unit tests}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 catkin\_make install run\_tests
\end{DoxyCode}


This will {\itshape not} work (\textquotesingle{}install\textquotesingle{} is required) \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 catkin\_make run\_tests
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Limitations}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There must be in the code a \char`\"{}manual\char`\"{} cleanup of the memory. See for example\+: \href{https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/amd-clmc/shared_memory/blob/master/src/examples/set_data.cpp#L16}{\tt set\+\_\+data}
\item Arrays, map and vectors are expected to be of a predefined fixed size. Even when using the \textquotesingle{}get\textquotesingle{} methods, they are expected to have been declared with the correct size (and with the correct set of keys for maps)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Removing shared memory file}

On linux, the shared memory mappings are created under {\ttfamily /dev/shm}. If necessary (e.\+g. if a program was creating the shared memory with the wrong permissions), these files can be delted manually.
